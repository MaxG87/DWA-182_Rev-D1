# Driver for rtl88x2bu wifi adaptors with focus on DWA-182

This repository is archived. It seems to be better to collaborate with [cilynx](https://github.com/cilynx) on his repository [rtl88x2bu](https://github.com/cilynx/rtl88x2bu). Come over there for new bugfixes.

Please note that the recent version of this repository compiles against Kernel 5.7, but does not run the device DWA-182_Rev-D1. On Debian it even crashes my system entirely. If there is a fix for that, it will only be found collaboratively on cilynx' repository.
